What is a virtual machine❓
A virtual machine is software that acts like a real computer. It can run programs and operating systems as if it were an actual machine. You can create multiple virtual computers on one physical computer. 
Each virtual machine works independently, so they don’t affect each other. It is useful for testing, learning, or running different systems on the same hardware. This way, you save money and space by not needing extra computers.

What is the purpose of virtual machines❓
The purpose of virtual machines is to make programs run the same way on any computer. They hide the details of the real hardware and operating system. 
This means you don’t need to worry about the computer’s setup. They create a consistent environment for running software. It makes testing, portability, and compatibility easier.
